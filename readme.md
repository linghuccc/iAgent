### Option 1: Local Installation

1. Clone this repository and navigate into it:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/iAgent.git
    cd iAgent
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Setup OpenAI api Key
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
4. Running the agent  
   To start the backend on a specified port (default is 5000), run:
    ```bash
    python agent_server.py --port 5000
    ```
    Once the agent is running, you can use quickstart.py to connect to it and interact with it via URL:

    docker build -t injective-agent .
    ```

3. Run the container:

    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      -p 5000:5000 \
      -e OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE>" \
      --name injective-agent \
      injective-agent
    ```

4. Connect to the agent:
    ```bash
    python quickstart.py --url http://localhost:5000
    ```

# AI Agent Usage Guide

This guide will help you get started with the AI Agent, including how to use commands, switch networks, and manage agents.
New agents can be saved and updated in the agents_config.yaml file,
the structure of the yaml file looks like

```yaml
agent10:
    address: <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>
    created_at: '2024-11-07'
    private_key: <YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATEKEY>
    network: <YOUR_DESIRED_NETWORK>
```

Please, ensure that your Open AI API project has enough credits as well as access to `gpt-4o` model.

# 额外解释：

本项目改自 Injective 的 iAgent 项目，不过应用的是通义千问 api，而不是 OpenAI api。

相对于原本的项目，只需要稍微改动 agent_server.py 文件和.env 文件，在 OPENAI_API_KEY 部分填入通义千问的 api key 即可。
